# social-network-api

## Description
This is an API template for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Usage
To explore the API, use a REST client such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/) to view, create, update and delete (CRUD) routes. 

## Installation
To install, first install the necessary packages by running npm i, then seed the data by running node utils/seed.js and finally spin up the server by running npm start.
